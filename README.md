# golangSimpleRESTApp

Practice on the Gin framwork, written in GoLang. The app holds Jazz albums and returns them when requested.

- Handle GET requests for all the albums using "/albums", 
- Handle GET requests with specific ID.
- Handle POST requests when adding to the list.

This is not connected to a database, as it is a simple program.
